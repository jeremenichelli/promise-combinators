# Promise combinators

[promise-combinators.netlify.com](//promise-combinators.netlify.com/)

Playground to explore how Promise combinators work.

_Heavily inspired by [Sara Drasner's Array Explorer](//github.com/sdras/array-explorer) and [this tweet by Stefan Judis](//twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1140535050230030336)._

## About the project

This site was built using [Next.js](//nextjs.org/), [styled-jsx](//github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) and lots of bad code, but hey, it works!

Hosted by [Netlify](//netlify.com) cause I have 99 problems in my life but deployments ain't one.

## About the combinators

Initially `Promise` was released with `all` and `race`, but there's a proposal for two new folks, `allSettled` and `any`, I hope this little microsite helps you exploring and understanding them better.
