# Promise combinators

Small site to explore how Promise combinators work.

_Heavily inspired by [Sara Drasner's Array Explorer](https://github.com/sdras/array-explorer) and [this tweet by Stefan Judis](https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1140535050230030336)._

## About the project

This site was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) and lots of bad code, but hey, it works! It's also hosted by [Netlify](//netlify.com) cause I have 99 problems in ym life but deployments ain't one.

## About the combinators

Initially `Promise` was released with `all` and `race`, but there's a proposal for two new folks, `allSettled` and `any`, I hope this little microsite helps you exploring and understanding them better.
